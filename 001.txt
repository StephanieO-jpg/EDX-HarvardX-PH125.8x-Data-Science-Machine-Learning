Q1
"Turbochamp" was one of the first algorithms written by famed British computer scientist, mathematician and crypto-analyst Alan Turing in the late 1940s. The artificial intelligence program was based on programmable rules derived from theory or first principles and could 'think' two moves ahead.
True or False: A key feature of machine learning is that the algorithms are built on data.
True

Q2
True or False: In machine learning, we build algorithms that take feature values (X) and train a model using known outcomes (Y) that is then used to predict outcomes when presented with features without known outcomes.
True

Q1
For each of the following, indicate whether the outcome is continuous or categorical.
Digit reader = categorical
Movie recommendation ratings = continuous
Spam filter = categorical
Number of hospitalizations = continuous
Siri = categorical

Q2
How many features are available to us for prediction in the mnist digits dataset?
784

Q3
In the digit reader example, the outcomes are stored here: y <- mnist$train$labels.
Do the following operations have a practical meaning?
Yes, because 9 + 2 = 11 and 9 > 2.
